## Summary

In this module you will learn the fundamentals of hybrid computing and Azure Arc. You will also learn the basics of Azure Arc-enabled data services including the overall architecture. Then you will learn the fundamentals of the major services in Azure Arc-enabled data services, SQL Managed Instance and PostgreSQL Hyperscale.

## Learning objectives

1. Understand how Azure Arc enabled-data services fits within the Azure Arc set of services.
2. Learn how Azure Arc-enabled data services provides a hybrid data solution
3. Understand a comparison Azure Arc-enabled data services and counterparts for on-premises and Azure solutions.

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    This unit will contain the summary of what the module provides, learning objectives, and pre-requisites.

1. **Hybrid computing and Azure Arc**

    This until will define what hybrid computing means and how Azure Arc provides solutions for hybrid scenarios.

    This solution will also describe Azure Arc-enabled infrastructure services to differentiate it from Azure Arc-enabled data services.

1. **Azure Arc-enabled data services fundamentals**

    This unit will define what services are included with Azure Arc-enabled data services and how Azure Arc-enabled data services provide Azure capabilities outside of Azure.

    This unit will also provide more details on the following topics:

    - Why Kubernetes is the platform required to support Azure Arc-enabled data services.
    - What are the connection modes to support Azure Arc-enabled data services
    - A description and visual of the Azure Arc-enabled data services architecture.
    - What interfaces can be used for Azure Arc-enabled data services.

    **Knowledge check**

    - Test knowledge of how Azure Arc-enabled data services is different from Azure Arc-enabled infrastructure services.
    - Test knowledge of direct vs indirect connected mode
    - Test knowledge of Azure Arc-enabled data services architecture

1. **Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance**

    This unit will describe what Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed instance provides and why it provides a hybrid data solution for SQL applications.

    This unit will also compare the features and management capabilities of Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance with SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance.

    This unit will also provide more details on the interfaces used with Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance.

    **Knowledge check**

    - Test knowledge of features Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance provides
    - Test knowledge of management capabilities Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance provides.
    - Test knowledge of interfaces used with Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance.
    
1. **Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale**

    This unit will describe what Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale provides and why it provides a hybrid data solution for PostgreSQL applications.

    This unit will also compare the features and management capabilities of Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale with PostgreSQL and Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

    This unit will also provide more details on the interfaces used with Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale.

1. **Summary**

    This unit will summarize the module and provide more resources to learn more including how to get started with resources like Azure Arc Jumpstart

## Notes

We have thoughts about building out these other modules as part of a learning path. This is just a working list and may not represent the actual modules. We believe based on the progression of new capabilities for Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance in CY21 that the complete learning path could be completed by end of CY21

- Module 2 - Deploy and Configure Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance
- Module 3 - Use and explore Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance
- Module 4 - Security Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance
- Module 5 - Deliver consistent performance with Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance
- Module 6 - Deploy highly available solutions using Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance
